    "### General\n",
    "1. Re-think overall strategy and steps, then just get on with them\n",
    "1. --- Split code into new files by section (modular)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Retrieving recipes\n",
    "1. --- Save html files one by one\n",
    "1. --- Make a clear plan for html retrieving / saving / reading and then edit functions accordingly\n",
    "    1. --- eg folder creation & naming, file naming etc (dated names => hard automatic retrieval)\n",
    "1. Retrieve 25,000 recipes\n",
    "\n",
    "### Processing\n",
    "1. --- Read in html files one by one\n",
    "1. --- Build in safety nets for html processing (currently gets stuck if no json found or sth)\n",
    "1. Check why some recipes get stuck in processing\n",
    "    1. Build in a workaround if appropriate\n",
    "\n",
    "### ML\n",
    "1. --- Build in printing of NMF analysis - Kenny\n",
    "1. --- Tree analysis - print out key features - Kenny\n",
    "1. Put stemming back in to NMF analysis re Kenny\n",
    "1. Once I have 25,000 recipes, use 15 components for NMF\n",
    "1. Explore the data\n",
    "    1. plot outliers, correlations etc"
